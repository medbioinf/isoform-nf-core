> _Documentation of pipeline parameters is generated automatically from the pipeline schema and can no longer be found in markdown files._

## Introduction

The current pipeline implements a reference-based path from FASTQ or SRA input to Salmon transcript quantification and IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR analysis. It does not discover de novo novel isoforms; transcripts must be present in the supplied transcript FASTA / GTF reference.

## Samplesheet input

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with a header row as shown in the examples below.

```bash
--input '[path to samplesheet file]'
```

### Multiple runs of the same sample

The `sample` identifiers have to be the same when you have re-sequenced the same sample more than once e.g. to increase sequencing depth. Re-sequenced rows for the same sample must use the same `condition`, `replicate`, `strandedness`, and `batch` values. The pipeline will concatenate the raw reads before performing any downstream analysis. Below is an example for the same sample sequenced across 3 lanes:

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,condition,replicate,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness,batch
CONTROL_REP1,control,1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto,batch1
CONTROL_REP1,control,1,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto,batch1
CONTROL_REP1,control,1,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto,batch1
```

### Full samplesheet

The pipeline will auto-detect whether a sample is single- or paired-end using the information provided in the samplesheet. The required columns are `sample`, `condition`, `replicate`, `fastq_1`, and `strandedness`; `fastq_2` and `batch` are optional.

A final samplesheet file consisting of both single- and paired-end data may look something like the one below. This is for 6 samples, where `TREATMENT_REP3` has been sequenced twice.

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,condition,replicate,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness,batch
CONTROL_REP1,control,1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto,batch1
CONTROL_REP2,control,2,AEG588A2_S2_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A2_S2_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto,batch1
CONTROL_REP3,control,3,AEG588A3_S3_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A3_S3_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto,batch1
TREATMENT_REP1,treatment,1,AEG588A4_S4_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,,auto,batch1
TREATMENT_REP2,treatment,2,AEG588A5_S5_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,,auto,batch1
TREATMENT_REP3,treatment,3,AEG588A6_S6_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,,auto,batch1
TREATMENT_REP3,treatment,3,AEG588A6_S6_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,,auto,batch1
```

| Column    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sample`  | Custom sample name. This entry will be identical for multiple sequencing libraries/runs from the same sample. Spaces in sample names are automatically converted to underscores (`_`). |
| `condition` | Biological or experimental condition for this sample, for example `control` or `treatment`. |
| `replicate` | Positive integer replicate number within the condition. |
| `fastq_1` | Full path to FastQ file for Illumina short reads 1. File has to be gzipped and have the extension ".fastq.gz" or ".fq.gz".                                                             |
| `fastq_2` | Full path to FastQ file for Illumina short reads 2. File has to be gzipped and have the extension ".fastq.gz" or ".fq.gz".                                                             |
| `strandedness` | Library strandedness. Must be one of `auto`, `forward`, `reverse`, or `unstranded`. |
| `batch` | Optional batch label for downstream analyses. |

An [example samplesheet](../assets/samplesheet.csv) has been provided with the pipeline.

### Contrast input

You can optionally provide a contrast file to define dataset-specific pairwise comparisons without changing the pipeline code:

```bash
--contrasts '[path to contrasts file]'
```

The file must contain `contrast`, `case`, and `control` columns. The `case` and `control` values must match values in the samplesheet `condition` column.

```csv title="contrasts.csv"
contrast,case,control
treated_vs_control,treatment,control
```

### Minimal SRA manifest input

As an alternative to `--input`, the pipeline can start from public SRA run accessions:

```bash
--sra_manifest '[path to SRA manifest file]'
```

The minimal SRA manifest contains sample metadata plus one run accession per row:

```csv title="sra_manifest.csv"
sample,condition,replicate,run_accession,strandedness,batch
CONTROL_REP1,control,1,SRR000001,auto,batch1
TREATMENT_REP1,treatment,1,SRR000002,auto,batch1
```

Multiple runs for the same biological sample can be represented as multiple rows with the same `sample`, `condition`, `replicate`, `strandedness`, and `batch` values. The pipeline downloads each run with `prefetch`, converts it with `fasterq-dump`, compresses the FASTQs, auto-detects single-end versus paired-end output, and then continues through the same FASTQ path as normal samplesheet input.

This is intentionally a minimal SRA mode. It expects run accessions such as `SRR...`, `ERR...`, or `DRR...`; it does not yet infer metadata automatically from `GSE` or `GSM` accessions.

SRA mode downloads the archive with `prefetch` before converting it with `fasterq-dump`. The default maximum archive size is `100G`; this can be changed with `--sra_prefetch_max_size`.

## Running the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run Anton-Bch/isoform-nf-core \
    --input ./samplesheet.csv \
    --contrasts ./contrasts.csv \
    --transcript_fasta ./reference/transcripts.fa.gz \
    --genome_fasta ./reference/genome.fa.gz \
    --gtf ./reference/annotation.gtf.gz \
    --outdir ./results \
    -profile docker
```

For SRA input, replace `--input` with `--sra_manifest`:

```bash
nextflow run Anton-Bch/isoform-nf-core \
    --sra_manifest ./sra_manifest.csv \
    --contrasts ./contrasts.csv \
    --transcript_fasta ./reference/transcripts.fa.gz \
    --genome_fasta ./reference/genome.fa.gz \
    --gtf ./reference/annotation.gtf.gz \
    --outdir ./results \
    -profile docker
```

This will launch the pipeline with the `docker` configuration profile. Docker is the recommended runtime for this pipeline and is the default runtime used by the test suite. See below for more information about profiles.

The current reusable path uses the transcript FASTA to build a Salmon index, the optional genome FASTA as decoy sequence for a more specific Salmon index, and the GTF to map transcript IDs back to genes. The transcript IDs should match between the transcript FASTA and GTF.

After Salmon quantification, the pipeline imports the transcript-level abundance estimates into `IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR`. If a contrast file is supplied, the pipeline runs the requested pairwise comparisons in one ISAR analysis when each contrast condition has at least two samples. If no contrast file is supplied, a two-condition dataset is tested as a single comparison. For very small smoke-test datasets, it still creates the `switchAnalyzeRlist` import object and records that statistical testing was skipped.

The pipeline also writes `isar/isar_contrast_summary/` by default. This directory contains a per-comparison significant-switch bar plot and an UpSet-style plot summarizing which significant isoform switches are shared across multiple contrasts.

GO enrichment can be enabled with `--run_go_enrichment`. This step takes significant switching genes from each ISAR contrast and asks whether they are over-represented in Gene Ontology or another WebGestaltR database. It is disabled by default because it adds a WebGestaltR runtime dependency and may require WebGestalt/database access.

Optional annotation modules can be enabled when you want biological interpretation of significant switch candidates:

- `--pfam_db` or `--pfam_results` adds protein-domain annotation.
- `--run_iupred2a` adds intrinsically disordered region and ANCHOR2 predictions.
- `--run_signalp` adds signal peptide predictions.
- `--run_deeptmhmm` adds transmembrane topology predictions.
- `--run_deeploc2` adds subcellular localization predictions.
- `--run_annotated_switch_plots` renders gene-level switch plots using the newest available annotation layers.

These modules are optional because they add extra runtime, storage, and container or database requirements. For quick statistical runs, leave them disabled. For publication-style inspection of selected genes, enable the relevant annotation modules and optionally set `--annotated_switch_genes`.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```bash
work                # Directory containing the nextflow working files
<OUTDIR>            # Finished results in specified location (defined with --outdir)
.nextflow_log       # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

If you wish to repeatedly use the same parameters for multiple runs, rather than specifying each flag in the command, you can specify these in a params file.

Pipeline settings can be provided in a `yaml` or `json` file via `-params-file <file>`.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `-c <file>` to specify parameters as this will result in errors. Custom config files specified with `-c` must only be used for [tuning process resource specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#tuning-workflow-resources), other infrastructural tweaks (such as output directories), or module arguments (args).

The above pipeline run specified with a params file in yaml format:

```bash
nextflow run Anton-Bch/isoform-nf-core -profile docker -params-file params.yaml
```

with:

```yaml title="params.yaml"
input: './samplesheet.csv'
contrasts: './contrasts.csv'
transcript_fasta: './reference/transcripts.fa.gz'
genome_fasta: './reference/genome.fa.gz'
gtf: './reference/annotation.gtf.gz'
run_isar: true
isar_dif_cutoff: 0.1
isar_qvalue_cutoff: 0.05
run_isar_visualization: true
isar_visualization_top_n: 10
run_pfam_prepare: false
pfam_results: null
pfam_db: null
pfam_top_n: 25
run_pfam_visualization: true
pfam_visualization_top_n: 12
run_iupred2a: false
iupred2a_top_n: 25
run_signalp: false
signalp_top_n: 25
run_deeptmhmm: false
deeptmhmm_top_n: 25
run_deeploc2: false
deeploc2_top_n: 25
run_annotated_switch_plots: false
annotated_switch_top_n: 10
annotated_switch_genes: null
annotated_switch_condition1: null
annotated_switch_condition2: null
annotated_switch_plot_topology: true
outdir: './results/'
<...>
```

You can also generate such `YAML`/`JSON` files via [nf-core/launch](https://nf-co.re/launch).

When `run_annotated_switch_plots` is used with `annotated_switch_genes`, enabled annotation modules also force-include those genes during protein FASTA preparation. This helps reproduce specific gene-level annotated switch plots even when upstream switch statistics differ slightly from another run.

### Updating the pipeline

When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:

```bash
nextflow pull Anton-Bch/isoform-nf-core
```

### Reproducibility

It is a good idea to specify the pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.

First, go to the [Anton-Bch/isoform-nf-core releases page](https://github.com/Anton-Bch/isoform-nf-core/releases) and find the latest pipeline version - numeric only (eg. `1.3.1`). Then specify this when running the pipeline with `-r` (one hyphen) - eg. `-r 1.3.1`. Of course, you can switch to another version by changing the number after the `-r` flag.

This version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future. For example, at the bottom of the MultiQC reports.

To further assist in reproducibility, you can use share and reuse [parameter files](#running-the-pipeline) to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles.

## Core Nextflow arguments

> [!NOTE]
> These options are part of Nextflow and use a _single_ hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen)

### `-profile`

Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Apptainer, Conda) - see below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to check if your system is supported, please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended, since it can lead to different results on different machines dependent on the computer environment.

- `test`
  - A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
  - Includes links to test data so needs no other parameters
- `docker`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- `singularity`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- `podman`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- `shifter`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/)
- `charliecloud`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Charliecloud](https://charliecloud.io/)
- `apptainer`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)
- `wave`
  - A generic configuration profile to enable [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/) containers. Use together with one of the above (requires Nextflow ` 24.03.0-edge` or later).
- `conda`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Please only use Conda as a last resort i.e. when it's not possible to run the pipeline with Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, or Apptainer.

### `-resume`

Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. For input to be considered the same, not only the names must be identical but the files' contents as well. For more info about this parameter, see [this blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html).

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

### `-c`

Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core Nextflow command). See the [nf-core website documentation](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration) for more information.

## Custom configuration

### Resource requests

Whilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the pipeline steps, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified [here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L18) it will automatically be resubmitted with higher resources request (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.

To change the resource requests, please see the [max resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#max-resources) and [tuning workflow resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#tuning-workflow-resources) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Containers

In some cases, you may wish to change the container or conda environment used by a pipeline steps for a particular tool. By default, nf-core pipelines use containers and software from the [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) or [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) projects. However, in some cases the pipeline specified version maybe out of date.

To use a different container from the default container or conda environment specified in a pipeline, please see the [updating tool versions](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#updating-tool-versions) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Tool Arguments

A pipeline might not always support every possible argument or option of a particular tool used in pipeline. Fortunately, nf-core pipelines provide some freedom to users to insert additional parameters that the pipeline does not include by default.

To learn how to provide additional arguments to a particular tool of the pipeline, please see the [customising tool arguments](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#customising-tool-arguments) section of the nf-core website.

### nf-core/configs

In most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter. You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

See the main [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more information about creating your own configuration files.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [Slack](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) on the [`#configs` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/configs).

## Running in the background

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

## Nextflow memory requirements

In some cases, the Nextflow Java virtual machines can start to request a large amount of memory.
We recommend adding the following line to your environment to limit this (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```bash
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```
